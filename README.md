##Data Structures & Algorithms I Final Project
The Final Project for this course was to implement the algorithm of Huffman together with a GUI in **Java**. The program should be able to receive text directly from the keyboard, or load an archives with the text to be compressed. Similarly, whenever the compression algorithm is executed, the program must store the keys and text generated
compressed into two text files (claves.txt and comprimido.txt).This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
